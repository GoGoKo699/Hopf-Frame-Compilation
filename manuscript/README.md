Working title: **Exact and Fault-Tolerant Compilation of Hopf Differential Frames**.

The [publication scope](PUBLICATION_SCOPE.md) fixes the three principal
results and their corollaries. The exact theorem covers every $m\geq0$
clean-workspace budget; the sufficient-clean and one-clean T-count
constructions keep their distinct clean/dirty reservations and return
guarantees.

## Scientific contribution

The paper develops a compiler capability: preserving an entire
operationally required frame while controlling exact entangling cost,
fault-tolerant precision cost, and initialized versus borrowed workspace.
The one-clean diagonal and general one-target multiplexor results also cover
standard operator families beyond Hopf frames. The earlier two-clean
constructions remain useful at their slightly smaller dirty reservations.

The principal synthesis comparisons are Yuan–Zhang's
[exact state-preparation tradeoffs](https://quantum-journal.org/papers/q-2023-03-20-956/)
(Quantum 7, 956), Low–Kliuchnikov–Schaeffer's
[dirty-workspace tradeoffs](https://quantum-journal.org/papers/q-2024-06-17-1375/)
(Quantum 8, 1375), and Gosset–Kothari–Wu's
[optimal T-count](https://quantum-journal.org/papers/q-2026-07-22-2168/)
(Quantum 10, 2168). The manuscript must explain the new complete-operator
guarantees relative to these results, with the attribution in the source map.

The [related-work comparison](../docs/RELATED_WORK.md) includes newer synthesis
results and distinguishes their input contracts and workspace assumptions.
The opening pages should explain why the prescribed frame
requires more than state preparation, identify the new proof mechanisms,
and state Results A–C with their resource assumptions. QBP provides the
operational motivation and consequence. The exact and fault-tolerant models
remain parts of one operator-compilation story; the open endpoint remains
in the discussion.

## Paper order

1. Prescribed completion versus one-column state preparation, with the
   two-qubit readout example.
2. Shared Hopf-frame and complete-input compiler contract.
3. Exact all-workspace size/depth theorem and its proof mechanisms.
4. Sufficient-clean matching T theorem, followed by the one-clean real-frame
   construction and its grouped, banked, diagonal, and general multiplexor
   corollaries. Retain the separately proved two-clean complex-magnitude and
   T-depth results with their own resource assumptions.
5. Exact and approximate fixed-parameter QBP consequences, including complete
   complex gradients and the costs of classical preprocessing and output.
6. The remaining endpoint gap and the limits of the circuit model.

Detailed schedules, source preparation, reversible lookup, error estimates,
and resource sums form the technical appendices. The exact toolkit credits
Yuan and Zhang; the [source map](../docs/SOURCE_MAP.md) gives the complete
attribution. Exploratory research is outside the selected manuscript.

The current task is to finish and integrate the scientific ingredients listed
in the [publication scope](PUBLICATION_SCOPE.md): analytic proofs, explicit
resource and error contracts, current comparisons, operational consequences,
and reproducible checks. Final LaTeX writing follows that consolidation;
external technical feedback and submission follow the complete draft.
The [open endpoint](../docs/OPEN_PROBLEM.md) is investigated separately and
must retain its actual status. Update `CITATION.cff` when a manuscript
identifier exists.
