# Exact and Fault-Tolerant Compilation of Hopf Differential Frames

### One prescribed frame, exact logical and fault-tolerant compilation

Exact state preparation normally specifies one initialized input:

```math
|0^n\rangle|0^m\rangle
\longmapsto
|\psi\rangle|0^m\rangle.
```

Hopf backpropagation uses a prescribed unitary completion: the state in its
first column and coordinate-frame directions in designated other columns.
Its inverse resolves a common objective response.

| Synthesis task | Required action |
|---|---|
| Exact state preparation | fix $U\lvert 0^n\rangle$ |
| Hopf differential-frame compilation | fix $W\lvert x\rangle$ for every system basis state $\lvert x\rangle$ and restore workspace according to its input promise |

This repository asks whether the prescribed Hopf completion can retain the same
size–depth frontier as arbitrary state preparation, and what implementing the
same frame costs at finite precision. The exact logical theorem covers every
clean-workspace budget. The fault-tolerant theorem gives a matched T-count
frontier in its stated clean/dirty-workspace regime. The
[publication scope](manuscript/PUBLICATION_SCOPE.md) selects one full-length
paper around these results and the two-clean construction. Scientific proofs,
comparisons, and checks are integrated here before final manuscript writing.

For questions about complete-frame synthesis, ancilla–depth or
T-count–precision tradeoffs, and Hopf QBP robustness, the
[LLM reading guide](llms.txt) maps the relevant proofs, assumptions, and
open problems.

## Two resource models

The mathematical target is the complete frame in both models. Their resource
bounds describe different compiler constructions; they do not assert one
circuit that simultaneously minimizes every cost.

| Model | Resource question | Scope of the matching theorem |
|---|---|---|
| Arbitrary one-qubit gates and CNOTs | exact size, CNOT count, and depth versus clean workspace | real and phase-dressed complex magnitude frames, every clean budget |
| Clifford+T | T-count versus accuracy and clean/dirty workspace | real and phase-dressed complex magnitude frames, every precision, under the sufficient clean reservation below |

### Exact logical theorem

Let

```math
N=2^n
```

and let $m\geq0$ be the number of clean ancillary qubits.  In the exact all-to-all
logical model with arbitrary one-qubit gates and CNOTs,

```math
\boxed{
S_{\mathbb R}(n,m)
=S_{\mathbb C,\mathrm{mag}}(n,m)
=\Theta(N)
}
```

and

```math
\boxed{
D_{\mathbb R}(n,m)
=D_{\mathbb C,\mathrm{mag}}(n,m)
=\Theta\left(n+\frac{N}{n+m}\right).
}
```

The upper bounds hold for every parameter tuple. The matching lower bounds
hold in the worst case over the Hopf-frame family, uniformly in the
clean-workspace budget. They do not impose the same cost on every individual
frame.

The worst-case **CNOT count alone is $\Theta(N)$ for $n\ge2$**,
with free one-qubit gates and arbitrary clean workspace; it is zero for $n=1$.
See the [separate lower-bound proof](docs/COMPILER_THEOREM.md#cnot-count-with-unrestricted-clean-workspace).

The real result concerns the complete Hopf differential frame.  The complex
result concerns the phase-dressed magnitude frame

```math
W_{\mathbb C,\mathrm{mag}}
=D_{\mathrm{ph}}W_{\mathbb R}.
```

The leaf-phase derivatives form a separate direct measurement stream; they are
not additional columns of the same $N$-dimensional unitary.

The construction uses at most the requested $m$ clean ancillary qubits and
returns them exactly to zero.  Thus a prescribed Hopf completion reaches the
optimal arbitrary-state-preparation frontier for every clean-workspace budget.

### Fault-tolerant theorem

Let $a$ be the number of initialized clean qubits and $b$ the number of borrowed
qubits in an arbitrary unknown state. Write

```math
q=n+a+b,\qquad
L=\max\{6,\lceil\log_2(1/\eta)\rceil\},\qquad
h=1+\lceil\log_2(L+n+2)\rceil.
```

For $0\lt \eta\leq1/64$ and a sufficiently large fixed constant $C$, both the
real frame and phase-dressed complex magnitude frame have matching worst-case T-count

```math
\boxed{
T^\star(n,a,b,\eta)
=\Theta\left(\sqrt{NL}+L+\frac{NL}{n+a+b}\right),
\qquad a\geq C(n+h).
}
```

The upper construction uses $O(NL)$ Clifford gates. Every supplied precision
source is prepared and charged. Borrowed qubits are restored jointly with any
external reference; complete-input approximation includes clean-work leakage.
There are no measurements, resets, or free supplied catalysts in this model.

**Why precision can be shared.** Binary tables correct a coarse frame using
one geometric source retained across the correction stream. One final
amplification gives the single additive $L$ term. The
[proof](docs/FAULT_TOLERANT_COMPILER.md) charges source preparation, retained
failure history, and every workspace register.

At $L=N$, sufficient $a=\Theta(n)$ and $b=\Theta(N)$ give $T^\star=\Theta(N)$.
The [two-clean operator-source construction](docs/OPERATOR_SOURCE_COMPILER.md)
uses **two clean qubits** and $N+O(\log N)$ dirty qubits to give
$O(N\log N)$ T gates for arbitrary prescribed real Hopf frames at the same precision.
The lower bound remains $\Omega(N)$: **a logarithmic gap is still open**.
The [open-problem statement](docs/OPEN_PROBLEM.md) gives the explicit endpoint
allocation. Smaller allocations retain the
[borrowed-workspace bound](docs/BORROWED_WORKSPACE_COMPILER.md).

The operator-source note also gives the same T-count order for the
phase-dressed complex magnitude frame, using two clean qubits and
$`b\ge L+n+8`$. It compiles the complete literal phase diagonal; the separate
leaf-phase derivative stream keeps its own QBP accounting.

Beyond Hopf frames, **literal diagonals and general one-target U(2)
multiplexors** attain $`\Theta(\sqrt{NL}+L+NL/b)`$ with two clean
qubits, respectively at $`b\ge2(L+n+5)`$ and $`b\ge2(L+n+7)`$.
For the multiplexor, $n$ counts address qubits and $N$ counts its blocks.
These matched one-stage frontiers do not close the multi-layer frame gap.

## Exact construction at a glance

The Hopf frame is a product of addressed tree layers.  At depth $d$, the prefix
selects one rotation angle and the complete lower suffix supplies a shared
all-zero predicate.  Three schedules exploit this structure.

| Workspace | Schedule | Mechanism |
|---:|---|---|
| $m=0$ | borrowed-suffix echo | one original suffix data qubit carries the predicate temporarily and is restored exactly |
| $1\leq m\lt 4n$ | direct flagged UCG | one reusable clean flag stores the suffix-zero predicate |
| larger $m$ | routed parallel subframes | a tree cut turns the tail into a direct sum; the suffix is routed coherently and the subtree frames run in parallel |

The threshold $4n$ is a convenient uniform proof threshold, not an optimized
finite-size crossover.

The [documentation map](docs/README.md) links every proof chapter, application,
source comparison, and reproduction guide. Direct routes to the
[QBP consequence](docs/QBP_CONSEQUENCE.md) and
[related-work comparison](docs/RELATED_WORK.md) complete the overview.

A reader needs quantum circuits, operator norms, and basic asymptotic notation.
The [minimal Hopf interface](docs/HOPF_INTERFACE.md) supplies the geometry;
knowledge of the earlier Hopf papers is useful but not required. Begin with the
two-qubit example in the narrative before reading the compiler machinery.

## Why the completion matters

The complete frame satisfies

```math
W_{\mathbb R}|0^n\rangle=|\psi\rangle,
\qquad
W_{\mathbb R}|\lambda(j)\rangle=|e_j\rangle.
```

At a regular coordinate,

```math
\partial_{\theta_j}|\psi\rangle
=a_j|e_j\rangle,
\qquad
g_{j,j}=a_j^2,
```

where $a_j$ is the oriented amplitude entering the corresponding tree node.  On
the canonical Hopf domains, $a_j\geq0$ and equals the principal metric square
root.  At zero metric weight the raw derivative vanishes, while the marker
column remains the chart-selected orthogonal continuation determined by the
complete parameter tuple.

A state-preparation-equivalent completion may move these marker columns.  The
repository contains an exact two-qubit example in which the state is unchanged
but the decoded gradient changes from

```math
(2,0,0)
\quad\longmapsto\quad
(0,\sqrt2,0).
```

The relevant compiler contract is therefore

```math
\widetilde W
\bigl(|\varphi\rangle|0^m\rangle\bigr)
=(W|\varphi\rangle)|0^m\rangle
```

for every system input $\lvert\varphi\rangle$, not only the forward preparation input.
At regular points, universal preservation of the fixed decoder's means
also forces this contract up to common phase; see the
[necessity theorem](docs/FRAME_SAFE_COMPILATION.md#necessity-for-all-observable-dependent-gradient-means).

## Relation to the all-workspace state-preparation framework

The proof uses four exact results from the all-workspace state-preparation
framework.

| Imported result | Role here |
|---|---|
| optimal QSP frontier | benchmark and matching comparison |
| ancilla-free multi-controlled X | zero-suffix predicates and toggles |
| all-workspace UCG synthesis | prefix-selected rotations, subtree frames, and the phase diagonal |
| coherent CNOT copy–uncopy | control fanout for the decoder and router |

Once the Hopf frame is written as addressed complete-operator layers, these
primitives can be adapted without surrendering the designated marker columns.
The Hopf-specific work is the operator factorization and the three workspace
schedules, not a replacement for the underlying state-preparation toolkit.

## Consequence for quantum backpropagation

Frame-safe compilation preserves the complete inverse-frame measurement
distribution.  Under the primary finite-shot target of simultaneous absolute
accuracy for the raw Hopf-coordinate gradient, the global magnitude stream uses

```math
O(\log n)=O(\log\log M)
```

independent executions at fixed accuracy and confidence, where
$M=\Theta(2^n)$ is the number of coordinates.

This is a matched-program statement: scalar and gradient programs use the same
forward preparation family and controlled observable, while the gradient
program adds one inverse frame of the same asymptotic logical depth as optimal
state preparation.  Classical materialization of an $M$-entry output is not
included in that quantum-depth ratio.

At finite precision, the [approximation bridge](docs/QBP_APPROXIMATION.md)
controls the bias of the same fixed-parameter, bounded-score estimator. It uses
the actual compiled circuit and its actual adjoint. It does not differentiate a
discontinuous family of compiled words. Frame-synthesis lower bounds alone do
not establish optimal gradient-query or training complexity.
The same proof now covers the complete complex gradient, reflection-sum
observables, rounded classical weights, and correlated dirty-bank reuse
between executions with fresh declared clean inputs.

## Verification boundary

The repository supplies:

- complete logical matrices for the frame identities and strict-zero echo;
- explicit reversible X/CNOT/Toffoli layers for the binary–one-hot decoder;
- explicit CNOT/Fredkin routing layers and arbitrary-entangled-input tests;
- exact integer or rational resource ledgers;
- parity, histogram, and fast Walsh–Hadamard gradient decoders.

The elementary UCG and multi-controlled-X decompositions are imported from the
state-preparation framework rather than regenerated locally.  Finite checks are
used to expose indexing, phase, order, cleanup, and resource errors; the
asymptotic theorem rests on the dimension-independent proof.

The fault-tolerant evidence adds exact finite source/kernel identities and
rational resource checks. It does not yet provide a general elementary emitter
for the complete asymptotic shared-source compiler. See the
[focused reproduction guide](verification/fault_tolerant/README.md).

Device connectivity, physical noise thresholds, optimal T-depth, arbitrary
non-Hopf charts, and application-independent observable costs remain outside
the claims. Clifford work, T work, quantum executions, and classical output
costs are reported separately.
