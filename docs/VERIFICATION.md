# Proof and executable correspondence

[← QBP consequence](QBP_CONSEQUENCE.md) · [Complete narrative](../REVIEW.md) · [Source map →](SOURCE_MAP.md)

The repository uses executable checks to test the conventions and constructions
that are easiest to get wrong: column labels, chronological order, relative
phases, coherent routing, work-register cleanup, and simultaneous resource
peaks.  The asymptotic theorem itself is established analytically.

## 1. Evidence levels

| Level | Meaning in this repository |
|---|---|
| analytic proof | a dimension-independent operator or resource argument |
| explicit construction | a complete reversible or logical-gate schedule is supplied |
| imported exact synthesis | an elementary compiler theorem is used under its stated model |
| finite regression check | independently constructed matrices, states, schedules, or ledgers are compared |

These levels are kept distinct.  A matrix test does not prove an asymptotic
bound, and an asymptotic bound does not certify an implementation's bit order.

## Claim-to-evidence index

The selected [Results A–D](../manuscript/PUBLICATION_SCOPE.md) are analytic
theorems. Their finite fixtures check conventions, literal phases, work
return, and resource accounting under the individual recorded contracts.

| Claim | Analytic proof | Principal executable evidence | Boundary |
|---|---|---|---|
| A: exact complete frame | [Compiler theorem](COMPILER_THEOREM.md) | Exact-frame, strict-zero, decoder, router, and resource suites in §§2–8 below | UCG and multi-controlled-X elementary synthesis are imported |
| B: sufficient-clean matching T count | [Fault-tolerant compiler](FAULT_TOLERANT_COMPILER.md) | [Four exact receipt suites](../verification/fault_tolerant/README.md), resource ledgers, and full-input approximation checks | Finite kernels and analytic resource proxies; no general native frame emitter |
| C: one-clean frame and corollaries | [One-clean compiler](ONE_CLEAN_COMPILER.md), [grouped extension](CONDITIONAL_SUFFIX_COMPILER.md) | [Operator-source checks](../tests/test_operator_source_compiler.py), one-clean word, amplification, grouped residual and bank-allocation fixtures | Small emitted words and matrices; operator-core return error is included in the joint norm |
| D: uniform count and T-depth | [Uniform-precision theorem](UNIFORM_PRECISION_DEPTH.md) | Unary-source, blocked-query, dirty-indicator, arithmetic, and uniform allocation suites | Same-circuit analytic schedule; finite fixtures do not emit every variable-size frame |
| Packed literal diagonals | [Operator-source Section 8](OPERATOR_SOURCE_COMPILER.md#8-literal-diagonal-unitaries-and-phase-dressed-frames) | [Exact packed-source words](../tests/test_packed_diagonal.py), all small sign masks, accepted complex blocks and full-output amplification identities | Bounded exact native source/block checks; the precision/workspace theorem and banked bounds are analytic |
| Fixed-tree endpoint reduction | [Tree Cayley proof](../research/endpoint/TREE_CAYLEY_REDUCTION.md) | [Exact phase/chart tests](../tests/test_tree_phase_chart.py): unequal and singular inputs, all small coarse patterns, resolvent, cut sums and Haar algebra | The all-angle reduction is proved; native synthesis of its Cayley core remains a separate hypothesis |

The [verification catalogue](reference/VERIFICATION_CATALOGUE.md) preserves
the complete per-fixture descriptions, negative controls, and software
boundaries, including separate [state-based QBP coverage](reference/VERIFICATION_CATALOGUE.md#state-based-qbp-coverage)
and optional research diagnostics. Its detailed records are not additional
claims of A–D.

## 2. What is represented locally

| Component | Local representation | Principal executable check | Imported ingredient |
|---|---|---|---|
| Hopf states and frames | dense matrices from independent recursive and addressed-layer constructions | complete equality, orthogonality, state and marker columns, chart domains, singular coordinates | Hopf geometry inherited from the earlier work |
| strict-zero echo | dense logical gates and exact reversible permutations | all four sectors, every nonfinal depth, full frames, inverse, and complex composition | UCG and ancilla-free MCT resource theorems |
| binary–one-hot decoder | explicit X/CNOT/Toffoli layers | basis action, arbitrary-basis reversibility, disjoint layers, counts, and clean return | constant-cost elementary decompositions |
| coherent router | explicit CNOT-fanout and Fredkin layers with sparse complex-state simulation | basis routing, entangled inputs, tail direct sum, complete cut, and zero leakage | coherent copy and constant-cost controlled gates |
| controlled subtree frames | exact logical token/flag-controlled rotations | equality to the ideal block-diagonal tail and flag cleanup | UCG and MCT synthesis |
| leaf-phase diagonal | exact block-diagonal UCG matrix | complete diagonal, inverse, common phase, and complex magnitude composition | UCG synthesis |
| resource theorem | integer and exact-rational ledgers | workspace peaks, schedule dispatch, endpoints, geometric sums, and cut inequalities | asymptotic primitive bounds |
| gradient records | parity, signed-histogram, and fast Walsh–Hadamard decoders | agreement of routes, empirical means, and deterministic record norms | QBP record identities |

The repository does not reproduce the elementary UCG or multi-controlled-X
compiler.  Those exact results are imported from the all-workspace
state-preparation framework.  Toffoli, Fredkin, controlled one-qubit gates, and
fixed-width controlled Givens rotations have exact constant-size,
constant-depth decompositions in the declared arbitrary-one-qubit+CNOT model.

## 3. Geometry and compiler contract

The frame suite checks:

- equality of the recursive and addressed-layer frames;
- real-frame orthogonality;
- phase-dressed complex magnitude-frame unitarity;
- the breadth-first marker convention;
- $g_{j,j}=a_j^2$ for unrestricted angles;
- $a_j=\sqrt{g_{j,j}}$ on the canonical domains;
- tolerance-aware regularity at floating-point chart boundaries;
- zero raw derivative and a unit chart-selected marker continuation at a
  singular coordinate.

The compiler-boundary fixtures check:

- two unitaries with the same prepared state but different marker columns;
- the resulting gradient change
  ```math
  (2,0,0)\longmapsto(0,\sqrt2,0);
  ```
- a checkpoint suffix that preserves one state but changes a derivative;
- an active-interface-safe suffix that preserves designated means without
  preserving the complete distribution.

Additional boundary tests exercise the sharp worst-observable sensitivity,
common-phase cancellation, projected marker error versus physical leakage,
and singular-marker ambiguity across all two-qubit Pauli observables.

- [compiler-boundary tests](../tests/test_compiler_boundaries.py)

## 4. Strict-zero construction

The strict-zero suite checks:

1. $C^2=R_y(\theta)$ and $XCX=C^{-1}$;
2. all four $(h,b)$ sectors;
3. exact restoration of the borrowed logical suffix bit;
4. absence of hidden workspace;
5. every nonfinal addressed depth through $n=8$;
6. complete real frames through $n=8$;
7. inverse frames and phase-dressed complex magnitude frames;
8. the endpoints $n=1$, $d=0$, $d=n-2$, and the final depth.

The resource audit checks, using exact arithmetic,

```math
\sum_{q=2}^{n}\frac{2^q}{q}
\leq6\frac{2^n}{n}
```

and the absorption of the polynomial predicate terms into $O(2^n/n)$.

- [resource-audit tests](../tests/test_strict_zero_audit.py)

## 5. Binary–one-hot prefix decoder

The decoder is tested as a complete reversible permutation, not only on its
intended clean input.  The suite verifies:

- $\lvert x\rangle\lvert0\rangle$ maps to $\lvert0\rangle\lvert e_x\rangle\lvert0\rangle$ and returns under the inverse;
- arbitrary computational-basis contents return after forward and inverse;
- every declared layer has disjoint wire support;
- the exact workspace formula
  ```math
  3\,2^t-2-t;
  ```
- the exact gate and depth formulas;
- the one-hot Givens network equals the complete prefix Hopf frame on the code.

- [decoder tests](../tests/test_tree_decoder.py)

## 6. Coherent route–operate–unroute

The router is supplied as an explicit schedule.  The tests cover:

- branch-data, token, copy, and reusable-flag register allocation;
- balanced prefix fanout and exact uncopy;
- disjoint Fredkin layers;
- every clean basis input routed to its prefix-selected branch;
- forward route followed by inverse route on arbitrary complex inputs;
- prefix–suffix-entangled inputs;
- token-controlled action of all subtree frames;
- cleanup of every branch flag before inverse routing;
- equality to
  ```math
  \bigoplus_r W_s^{(r)};
  ```
- equality of the complete routed cut to the direct Hopf frame;
- zero probability outside the clean-workspace subspace.

The explicit schedule is cross-checked against

```math
\text{copy wires}=(2^t-1)(s+1)-t,
```

```math
\text{forward Fredkins}=(2^t-1)(s+1).
```

The simulator iterates over branches for convenience.  The circuit-depth claim
uses the declared parallel schedule: branch data, tokens, flags, and subtree
frames have disjoint physical support.

- [tree identities](../compiler_robust_hopf/tree_structure.py)

## 7. Resource theorem

The ledgers use integer or exact-rational checks rather than fitted slopes.  They
cover:

- strict zero workspace;
- the one-clean-flag endpoint;
- the direct-to-routed transition;
- maximal feasible cuts over broad $n,m$ grids;
- copy-pool reuse as branch flags;
- the $s=1$ routed endpoint;
- arbitrarily large workspace;
- matching real-state parameter and light-cone lower bounds.

Representative checked implications are

```math
n^2
=O\left(\frac{2^n}{n+m}\right)
\qquad(1\leq m\lt 4n),
```

and

```math
\frac{2^s}{s}
=O\left(1+\frac{2^n}{n+m}\right)
```

for the maximal routed cut, including the saturated endpoint $`s=1`$.

- [resource diagnostics](../compiler_robust_hopf/resource_bounds.py)
- [general resource tests](../tests/test_resource_bounds.py)
- [unified compiler tests](../tests/test_unified_compiler.py)

## 8. Gradient records

The decoder suite compares:

- direct record-wise parity averages;
- dense Walsh transforms;
- the fast Walsh–Hadamard implementation;
- direct phase-stream signed one-hot records.

It verifies the deterministic norm-two record property used by the
coordinatewise concentration statement.

- [decoder tests](../tests/test_decoders.py)

## 9. Reproduce the checks

Use Python 3.11 or 3.13. From the repository root:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python scripts/reviewer_walkthrough.py
python validate.py
python scripts/verify_fault_tolerant.py
```

The last two commands run the deterministic unittest collection and the
four separate exact receipt suites. Resource ledgers and offline provenance:

```bash
python scripts/unified_resource_ledger.py --n 12
python scripts/strict_zero_echo_ledger.py --n 12
python scripts/check_upstream_sync.py --offline
```

The [rendering guide](../assets/README.md#rendering-checks) covers diagrams,
Markdown, MathJax, and native MathML; [detailed coverage](reference/VERIFICATION_CATALOGUE.md#rendering-checks)
records its limits. Local previews do not reproduce GitHub's private renderer.

## 10. Evidence boundary

The repository does not use finite experiments to establish asymptotic
optimality.  It also does not test:

- device connectivity or routing overhead;
- a hardware-native gate set;
- a general elementary-gate emitter for the full asymptotic Clifford+T compiler;
- noisy execution or readout mitigation;
- application-specific controlled-observable implementations;
- arbitrary non-Hopf differential frames.

The proof should be assessed in four separate steps:

1. the Hopf operator identities;
2. the logical circuits and workspace cleanup;
3. the imported synthesis bounds and resource sums;
4. the matched QBP output and access conventions.

## 11. Fault-tolerant evidence and approximate QBP

The [fault-tolerant theorem](FAULT_TOLERANT_COMPILER.md) separates the analytic
resource proof from the [focused finite checks](../verification/fault_tolerant/README.md).
Run `python scripts/verify_fault_tolerant.py` from the repository root. Four
stdlib-only suites reproduce the retained exact Gray-source, shift-kernel,
resource, and reflection receipts without changing their saved reference files.
The runner compares scientific receipt fields and separately verifies the
deterministic source-file hashes, whose values changed when the sources were
relocated into this repository.

| Standalone receipt suite | What it checks | Evidence boundary |
|---|---|---|
| Gray geometric source | Emitted logical source words, actual inverse, scratch return, reference witnesses, and gate-count recurrences | Finite clean-scratch fixtures; the full source is not emitted as an elementary Clifford+T circuit |
| Shift kernel | Complete finite kernel columns, actual inverses, source defects, failure tracking, and negative controls | Small fixed parameters, without the production residual construction or emitted outer amplification |
| Shift resource | Exact rational scales, coefficient rounding, scalar error budgets, and resource ledgers | Analytic proxies and inequalities; the rows are not measured gate counts |
| Geometric reflection | Small source/reflection matrices, exact Pauli-transfer arithmetic, and algebraic norm separation | Supporting source-cost evidence and a kernel-suite dependency; no additive lower bound follows from these fixtures |

The [receipt map](../verification/fault_tolerant/README.md) records the exact
fixture ranges, source dependencies, and provenance for all four suites.

The [approximation bridge](QBP_APPROXIMATION.md) has tests for full-input error,
actual-adjoint transfer, leakage, reference-entangled borrowed inputs, and
bounded estimator bias. These validate the finite examples behind the general
proof, not differentiation of a synthesized family.

The approximation suite also checks the complex phase stream directly,
reflection-term sampling, pathwise finite-weight error, and a two-shot
measurement instrument whose retained dirty state changes the next-shot law.
The last fixture tests the conditional-mean premise of the martingale proof;
it is not a fitted statistical scaling experiment.
