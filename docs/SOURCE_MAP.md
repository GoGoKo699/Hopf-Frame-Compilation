# Source and dependency map

[← Verification](VERIFICATION.md) · [Complete narrative](../REVIEW.md) · [Related work →](RELATED_WORK.md)

This page separates the proof into three layers:

1. an exact state-preparation compiler toolkit imported from the literature;
2. a compact Hopf frame and QBP interface inherited from the earlier Hopf work;
3. complete-operator factorizations, schedules, and bounds proved in this
   repository.

The tables identify the precise fact used, rather than citing an entire paper as
a premise. Section 5 adds the separate Clifford+T toolkit. Yuan–Zhang remains
the normative framework for the exact arbitrary-one-qubit+CNOT theorem; the
fault-tolerant theorem has its own precision and workspace hypotheses.

## 1. Imported state-preparation toolkit

The normative compiler citation is:

> P. Yuan and S. Zhang, “Optimal (controlled) quantum state preparation and
> improved unitary synthesis by quantum circuits with any number of ancillary
> qubits,” *Quantum* **7**, 956 (2023),
> doi:10.22331/q-2023-03-20-956.

The published article corresponds to `arXiv:2202.11302v2`.  The imported
statements below were also checked in `arXiv:2202.11302v3`; their conclusions and
exact arbitrary-one-qubit+CNOT model are unchanged for the uses made here.

| ID | Imported result | Exact use in this repository | Local consumer |
|---|---|---|---|
| C1 | Theorem 2: exact arbitrary state preparation has $\Theta(2^n)$ size and $`\Theta\!\left(n+\frac{2^n}{n+m}\right)`$ depth for every clean-workspace budget | comparison frontier and target lower-bound scale | [compiler theorem](COMPILER_THEOREM.md), [`unified_compiler.py`](../compiler_robust_hopf/unified_compiler.py) |
| C2 | Lemma 5: exact ancilla-free multi-controlled X has linear size and depth | strict-zero toggles, direct suffix flags, and branch predicates | [`strict_zero_echo.py`](../compiler_robust_hopf/strict_zero_echo.py), [`router.py`](../compiler_robust_hopf/router.py) |
| C3 | Lemma 6: a total-width-$`q`$ UCG with $w$ clean work qubits has $O(2^q)$ size and $`O\!\left(q+\frac{2^q}{q+w}\right)`$ depth | half-angle UCGs, flagged layers, subtree frames, and the phase diagonal | [`strict_zero_echo.py`](../compiler_robust_hopf/strict_zero_echo.py), [`unified_compiler.py`](../compiler_robust_hopf/unified_compiler.py) |
| C4 | Lemma 9: coherent CNOT-tree copying and exact uncopying | control fanout in the conditioned prefix and coherent router | [`tree_decoder.py`](../compiler_robust_hopf/tree_decoder.py), [`router.py`](../compiler_robust_hopf/router.py) |
| C5 | Theorem 1: generic controlled state preparation depends on combined index and target width | comparison showing why a generic all-column construction would have quadratic Hilbert-space scale | [`resource_bounds.py`](../compiler_robust_hopf/resource_bounds.py), [related work](RELATED_WORK.md) |

The preceding state-preparation paper by Sun, Tian, Yang, Yuan, and Zhang is
retained as the historical source of the earlier time–space landscape and of
selected primitives credited by the later article.  The active proof uses the
uniform all-workspace framework above rather than selecting between the two
papers by regime.

## 2. Inherited Hopf operator interface

The compiler construction does not depend on the complete optimization
framework.  It consumes the following facts.

| ID | Inherited fact | Source role | Local restatement or implementation |
|---|---|---|---|
| H1 | a balanced complete binary tree with $N=2^n$ leaves gives $N-1$ real magnitude coordinates | chart definition | [Hopf interface](HOPF_INTERFACE.md), [`frames.py`](../compiler_robust_hopf/frames.py) |
| H2 | the sine–cosine path map covers normalized real states; leaf phases give the complex chart | forward state map | [`real_tree_data`](../compiler_robust_hopf/frames.py), [`complex_state`](../compiler_robust_hopf/complex_analysis.py) |
| H3 | real nonfinal angles use $[0,\pi/2]$, the final real depth uses $[0,2\pi)$, and complex magnitudes use $[0,\pi/2]$ | canonical chart domains | [`canonical_magnitude_angle_mask`](../compiler_robust_hopf/frames.py), [`test_frames.py`](../tests/test_frames.py) |
| H4 | the oriented incoming amplitude obeys $\partial_{\theta_j}\lvert\psi\rangle=a_j\lvert e_j\rangle$ and $g_{j,j}=a_j^2$ | differential geometry | [`RealTreeData.incoming_amplitude`](../compiler_robust_hopf/frames.py), [`test_complex_analysis.py`](../tests/test_complex_analysis.py) |
| H5 | on the canonical domains $a_j\geq0$, so $a_j=\sqrt{g_{j,j}}$ | canonical-domain consequence | [`test_frames.py`](../tests/test_frames.py) |
| H6 | if $g_{j,j}=0$, the raw differential vanishes while the parameter tuple still selects a unit marker-frame continuation | singular-coordinate boundary | [`regular_coordinate_mask`](../compiler_robust_hopf/frames.py), singular tests in [`test_frames.py`](../tests/test_frames.py) |
| H7 | the marker $\lambda(j)$ places the state and coordinate-frame directions in one known computational basis | differential-frame interface | [`conventions.py`](../compiler_robust_hopf/conventions.py), [`frames.py`](../compiler_robust_hopf/frames.py) |
| H8 | the complete real frame is a product of prefix-selected rotations restricted to the zero-suffix sector | addressed-frame structure | [Hopf interface](HOPF_INTERFACE.md), [`direct_addressed_depth_layer`](../compiler_robust_hopf/frames.py) |
| H9 | the phase-dressed complex magnitude frame is $W_{\mathbb C,\mathrm{mag}}=D_{\mathrm{ph}}W_{\mathbb R}$ | complex magnitude interface | [`complex_magnitude_frame_matrix`](../compiler_robust_hopf/frames.py) |

The complete inverse map and optimization context are contained in the first
Hopf paper and repository.  The addressed frame, global magnitude record,
direct phase record, checkpoint interface, and statistical task boundaries are
contained in `Hopf-QBP`.

## 3. Inherited QBP interface

The tracked `Hopf-QBP/main` baseline is

```text

```

and is reconciled in [`SYNC.md`](../SYNC.md) and
[`provenance/upstream.json`](../provenance/upstream.json).

| ID | QBP fact used here | Role in the compiler consequence | Local counterpart |
|---|---|---|---|
| Q1 | the global magnitude circuit applies the complete inverse differential frame | fixes the required compiler contract | [frame-safe compilation](FRAME_SAFE_COMPILATION.md) |
| Q2 | one X-basis outcome contributes a parity record to every magnitude coordinate | shared-record mechanism | [`decoders.py`](../compiler_robust_hopf/decoders.py), [`test_decoders.py`](../tests/test_decoders.py) |

| Q5 | complete-vector, relative, normalized-frame, and natural-gradient targets have different conditioning | prevents overextension of the raw-coordinate claim | [QBP consequence, Section 5](QBP_CONSEQUENCE.md#5-statistical-target) |
| Q6 | the validated core assumes phase-calibrated controlled access to a Hermitian unitary observable | access-model premise | [QBP consequence, Section 2](QBP_CONSEQUENCE.md#2-controlled-observable-interface) |
| Q7 | a checkpoint compiler needs equality on its active interface, not merely one state column | separate checkpoint boundary | [compiler boundaries](COMPILER_BOUNDARIES.md) |

## 5. Fault-tolerant sources and contribution boundaries

The [fault-tolerant compiler](FAULT_TOLERANT_COMPILER.md) uses a complete
initialized-isometry approximation, uniformly over logical and dirty inputs
and their references. In that sufficient-clean construction, dirty workspace
is restored exactly; initialized logical work may have residual error included
in the isometry norm. The operator-source constructions below, including their one-clean
refinement, instead include the dirty operator core's return error in that norm, while returning
lookup banks, selectors, and suffix-control work exactly. These are distinct
return guarantees within the complete-input approximation model, separate
from the exact clean-workspace size–depth theorem.

| F18 | [Boyd–Vandenberghe, Convex Optimization](https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/bv_cvxbook.pdf), Appendix A.5.5 | quadratic elimination and Schur complements | standard linear algebra; the weighted-block note supplies the scalar tree recursion, local rejection correction, and mode allocation |
| F19 | [Barenco et al., arXiv:quant-ph/9503016v1](https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/9503016v1), Lemma 4.1 and Section 8 | Euler factors, two-level unitary decomposition, and Gray-code basis routing | inherited generic synthesis; the local pricing uses the retained borrowed-sector echo and does not claim an optimal native implementation |
| F20 | [Brassard–Høyer–Mosca–Tapp, arXiv:quant-ph/0005055](https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/0005055), Section 2, Eqs. (7)–(8) | repeated amplitude amplification and its sine/cosine law | the five-call one-clean amplification is a specialization at amplitude $`\sin(\pi/10)`$; the local proof supplies the oblivious complete-isometry error and literal-phase accounting |

Standard Pauli linear combinations, reversible arithmetic, and oblivious
amplitude amplification are used with their actual preparations and adjoints.
The operator and workspace arguments that instantiate them are part of the
local construction, not additional oracle assumptions.

The exact operator-source lower bound uses
[Gosset–Kliuchnikov–Mosca–Russo, Sections 2.3 and 4](https://arxiv.org/html/1308.4134v1),
for the Pauli-transfer denominator method. The local proof supplies its
source-specific witnesses and normalization through returned helpers.
The correlated-shot extension uses
[Pinelis, Theorem 3.5](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1208.2200v2), with bounded
Hilbert-space martingale increments; the concentration inequality itself
is inherited.

| ID | Local fault-tolerant result | Contribution and support |
|---|---|---|
| R12 | exact compact capped geometric preparation | simultaneous linear T count and logarithmic peak clean width, with ordinary binary labels and exact temporary return; refines the implementation of the established geometric source |
| R13 | addressed SU(2) sampling and direct frame composition | complete operator contract with small clean work; combines fixed Pauli atoms, geometric bit sampling, and charged dirty lookup |
| R14 | shared-source composition of frame residuals | the uniform-precision construction combines accepted-branch shifts and a retained source with the inherited compression gadget F10 and amplification F11; see [theorem and proof](FAULT_TOLERANT_COMPILER.md) |
| R15 | matching T-count in the stated workspace regimes | the sufficient-clean [theorem](FAULT_TOLERANT_COMPILER.md) plus the F3/F4 reductions; the separate all-clean-budget [corollary and borrowed-workspace proof](BORROWED_WORKSPACE_COMPILER.md) also uses the arbitrary-budget compiler under its additional condition |
| R16 | fixed-parameter bounded-score robustness | [QBP approximation](QBP_APPROXIMATION.md): complete complex gradient, reflection sums, rounded weights, correlated dirty-bank reuse, and quantum/classical budgets; no derivative of a compiled word or gradient-query optimum |
| R17 | two-clean operator-source compiler and corollaries | [proof](OPERATOR_SOURCE_COMPILER.md): full-frame $O(N+nL)$ bound and dirty-bank refinement; matched literal diagonal and general one-target U(2) multiplexor frontiers; all have separate explicit reservations and include operator-core return error |
| R18 | exact geometric operator-source costs | [source proof](OPERATOR_SOURCE_COMPILER.md#exact-source-costs-including-returned-helpers): $2m-4$ uncontrolled and $2m-2$ controlled T gates, even with returned helpers; native words and transfer witnesses checked for small $m$ |
| R19 | sufficient-clean complex-frame extension | [Corollary 7](FAULT_TOLERANT_COMPILER.md#92-literal-diagonals-and-the-complex-magnitude-frame): literal diagonal SU(2) embedding, same-pool composition, and diagonal-subfamily lower bounds |
| R20 | conditional-suffix compiler | [proof](CONDITIONAL_SUFFIX_COMPILER.md): $`O(N+L\ell_*(n))`$ T gates and $`O(NL)`$ Clifford gates for $`n\ge1`$, $`L\ge6`$, $`a=2`$, $`b\ge L+n+7`$; star residuals and streamed coarse programs use $`O(\log(s+1))`$ private clean work per group of $`s`$ depths |
| R21 | two-clean T-depth upper bound | [schedule](T_DEPTH_COMPILER.md): $`D_T=O(NL/b+L\ell_*(n)+n^4)`$, $`T,G=O(NL)`$, at $`b\ge2(L+n+7)`$; combines inherited F2 routing with the complete-frame source, coarse-program, and conditional-work ledgers; no matching depth claim |
| R22 | structured residual and scoped endpoint diagnostics | [source-reuse analysis](SOURCE_REUSE_LIMITS.md) and [tree transport](ENDPOINT_TREE_TRANSPORT.md): linear generator representation, explicit normalized transport unitary, weighted norm bounds using F17, finite-order correction witnesses, and Pauli-routed leakage; no new unrestricted frame lower bound or improved endpoint T-count |
| R23 | simultaneous two-clean count and depth | [parallel dirty lookup](PARALLEL_DIRTY_LOOKUP.md): exact bilinear echoes instantiate the F2 indicator idea with literal phases and explicit returned dirty work; complete real-frame composition retains count-efficient banks under a sufficient square-root-scale width condition; no new general lookup tradeoff or optimal T-depth claim |
| R24 | forward weighted transport component | [weighted block](WEIGHTED_TRANSPORT_BLOCK.md): exact weighted Gram witness, scalar recursion using F18, complete one-signal-flag dilation, and certified singular-case preprocessing; F19 and the borrowed reflection interpreter give $`O(L\sqrt N)`$ native T count with exact dirty return, while its borrowed-signal extension gives $`O(N+nL)`$ with one block signal and approximate dirty return; routing is charged, and neither improves the full-frame endpoint bound |
| R25 | one-clean operator-source compiler and corollaries | [proof](ONE_CLEAN_COMPILER.md): conjugated scalar-source word and Pauli-routed anticommutator, native head-and-two-tail source, and fixed five-call amplification using F20; real grouped/banked bounds extend to $`a=1`$, as do phase-dressed complex magnitude frames by sequential composition at their separate threshold; X symmetry gives a zero-clean layerwise real-frame corollary; matched literal-diagonal and complete U(2) multiplexor bounds retain their own reservations; F2/F9 supply inherited lookup and Clifford-algebra ingredients, and no new T-depth claim is made |

For polynomial accuracy-bit budgets, the direct sampler can already attain the
matching T count. That regime is not attributed to the later shared-source
composition. The latter removes the repeated precision cost uniformly over
precision. Write $`\ell_*(n)=1+\log_2^*(n+2)`$, where $`\log_2^*`$
counts base-two logarithms until the value is at most one. Conditional-suffix
grouping and its one-clean refinement give the constant-clean endpoint upper bound $`O(N\ell_*(n))`$.
The gap from $`\Omega(N)`$ remains at the
[selected high-precision endpoint](OPEN_PROBLEM.md).
At $`b\ge2(L+n+7)`$, the grouped compiler's banked form gives
$`O(\sqrt{NL}+L\ell_*(n)+NL/b)`$ T gates and $`O(NL)`$ Clifford gates.

The two-clean proof uses the
[two-pass dirty lookup](BORROWED_WORKSPACE_COMPILER.md#2-exact-dirty-table-and-reflection-interpreter)
and [borrowed predicate toggle](BORROWED_WORKSPACE_COMPILER.md#3-an-exact-echo-selects-a-logical-sector)
proved in the borrowed-workspace appendix, together with amplification and
the lower bounds stated in the fault-tolerant chapter.
The conditional-suffix refinement resolves the sparse grouped-residual
support into forward and reverse rank-one stars and a diagonal. Depth labels,
marker predicates, and variable suffix Hadamards replace full endpoint words;
coarse programs stream one symbol at a time. Its private work is initialized
only in an explicitly selected logical sector. The dirty operator source
supplies precision without an initialized precision register.

The source audit supports these precise dependencies and comparisons. It does
not certify priority or infer novelty from a bounded search finding no match.
The current general-unitary benchmark includes Yuan–Zhang–Zi rather than
treating Tan as the newest result. The literal-diagonal theorem and its one-clean refinement
are separately compared with GKW and Yamazaki–Akibue in
[related work, Section 12](RELATED_WORK.md#12-contemporary-comparisons-and-the-broader-compiler-contribution).

## 6. Evidence classification

The local evidence separates the following kinds of support.

| Level | Examples |
|---|---|
| analytic identity | addressed layers, echo sectors, tree cut, lower bounds |
| explicit reversible construction | binary–one-hot decoder and coherent router |
| imported exact synthesis | elementary UCG and multi-controlled-X circuits |
| finite regression evidence | matrix equality, entangled-input routing, cleanup, and resource ledgers |
| fault-tolerant analytic construction | compact source, complete sampler block, shared-source composition, and charged resource proof |
| fault-tolerant finite checks | exact small circuits and arithmetic certificates described in the [verification index](../verification/fault_tolerant/README.md) |

The finite checks are designed to expose convention, indexing, order, phase,
cleanup, and resource errors. They do not replace the asymptotic proofs. The
fault-tolerant checks are not a general emitted Clifford+T frame compiler.

## 7. Provenance records

- [`provenance/upstream.json`](../provenance/upstream.json): upstream commits,
  file lineage, and reconciliation;
- [`provenance/literature.json`](../provenance/literature.json): compiler source
  versions and role assignments;
- [`SYNC.md`](../SYNC.md): human-readable synchronization policy.

These records preserve provenance and source discipline; they are not additional
scientific assumptions.

The [borrowed-workspace appendix](BORROWED_WORKSPACE_COMPILER.md) condenses
the original research derivations in `Hopf_Fault_Tolerant_Research.md`,
Sections 4.5–4.6, 4.8 and 5.19, and `Hopf_Small_Clean_Workspace.md`.
Those filenames identify its historical source, not additional proof or runtime
dependencies. The appendix contains the complete real-frame argument used by
this publication, including the dirty lookup, exact sector echo, resource sum,
and restricted matching splice.
