# Hopf interface used by the compiler

[← Landing page](../README.md) · [Complete narrative](../REVIEW.md) · [Formal compiler theorem →](COMPILER_THEOREM.md)

The compiler theorem needs only a compact interface from the Hopf construction.
The inverse coordinate map, optimization experiments, and the complete QBP
protocol remain in the two earlier Hopf repositories.

## 1. Four facts consumed by the synthesis proof

Fix $n$ system qubits and write

```math
N=2^n.
```

The real Hopf construction supplies a unitary $W_{\mathbb R}(\boldsymbol\theta)$ with the following
properties.

### State column

```math
\boxed{
W_{\mathbb R}|0^n\rangle
=|\psi_{\mathbb R}(\boldsymbol\theta)\rangle.
}
```

### Marker columns

For every internal tree node $j$, a nonzero computational marker $\lambda(j)$ is
assigned to a unit frame direction $\lvert e_j\rangle$:

```math
\boxed{
W_{\mathbb R}|\lambda(j)\rangle
=|e_j(\boldsymbol\theta)\rangle.
}
```

### Coordinate differential

Let $a_j(\boldsymbol\theta)$ be the oriented amplitude entering node $j$.  Then

```math
\boxed{
\partial_{\theta_j}|\psi\rangle
=a_j|e_j\rangle,
\qquad
g_{j,j}=a_j^2.
}
```

### Addressed-layer product

The frame is a product of $n$ complete-operator layers:

```math
\boxed{
W_{\mathbb R}^{(n)}
=L_{n-1}^{(n)}\cdots L_1^{(n)}L_0^{(n)},
}
```

with $L_0$ acting first.

These four statements define the synthesis target.  In particular, the target
is not specified only by the state column.

## 2. Tree and marker convention

The $N-1$ magnitude coordinates are indexed by the internal nodes of a complete
binary tree.  Nodes are numbered breadth first, beginning at one.  If node $j$
has depth $d$ and position $r$, then

```math
j=2^d+r,
\qquad
0\leq r\lt 2^d.
```

Its marker is

```math
\boxed{
\lambda(j)=(2r+1)2^{n-d-1}.
}
```

The corresponding bit string consists of:

1. the $d$-bit prefix locating the node;
2. a one at the node's target position;
3. zeros in every lower position.

The state occupies marker zero.  The remaining markers place the frame
directions in a known computational basis, which is what makes inverse-frame
readout possible.

### Notation

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| $n$ | number of system qubits |
| $N=2^n$ | Hilbert-space dimension |
| $m$ | clean ancillary qubits supplied to the compiler |
| $j$ | breadth-first internal-node index |
| $d$ | depth of node $j$ |
| $r$ or $p$ | position or prefix at depth $d$ |
| $\theta_{d,p}$ | magnitude angle at that node |
| $a_j$ | oriented incoming amplitude |
| $g_{j,j}=a_j^2$ | diagonal metric weight |
| $\lvert e_j\rangle$ | unit marker-frame direction |
| $\lambda(j)$ | computational marker assigned to $\lvert e_j\rangle$ |
| $W_{\mathbb R}$ | real Hopf differential frame |
| $D_{\mathrm{ph}}$ | diagonal leaf-phase layer |
| $W_{\mathbb C,\mathrm{mag}}=D_{\mathrm{ph}}W_{\mathbb R}$ | phase-dressed complex magnitude frame |

Basis labels are ordered from the most significant tree decision to the least
significant one.  The implementation uses the corresponding nonnegative integer
labels.

## 3. Incoming amplitude, metric, and chart boundary

At each internal node, the local split is

```math
|v_j\rangle
=\cos\theta_j|v_{2j}\rangle
+\sin\theta_j|v_{2j+1}\rangle.
```

Differentiating the local split produces the unit complement

```math
|e_j\rangle
=-\sin\theta_j|v_{2j}\rangle
+\cos\theta_j|v_{2j+1}\rangle.
```

The derivative of the complete state carries the amplitude that has already
reached node $j$.  This amplitude is the product of the ancestor sine and cosine
factors selected by the path to $j$:

```math
\partial_{\theta_j}|\psi\rangle
=a_j|e_j\rangle.
```

For unrestricted real angles, $a_j$ may be negative.  The metric entry and its
principal square root are

```math
g_{j,j}=a_j^2,
\qquad
\sqrt{g_{j,j}}=|a_j|.
```

### Canonical domains

For the real chart:

- depths $0,\ldots,n-2$ use
  ```math
  [0,\pi/2];
  ```
- the final magnitude depth uses
  ```math
  [0,2\pi),
  ```
  which carries the leaf signs.

For the complex chart, every magnitude angle uses

```math
[0,\pi/2],
```

and the leaf phases carry the complex arguments.

Only ancestor angles enter an internal node's incoming amplitude.  The final
real depth therefore does not affect the sign of any $a_j$.  On both canonical
magnitude domains,

```math
a_j\geq0,
\qquad
a_j=\sqrt{g_{j,j}}.
```

### Singular coordinates

If

```math
g_{j,j}=0,
```

then

```math
\partial_{\theta_j}|\psi\rangle=0.
```

There is no derivative-normalized tangent at that parameter value.  The unit
vector in marker column $\lambda(j)$ remains the chart-selected orthogonal
continuation determined by the complete parameter tuple.  The compiler target
is therefore still a well-defined unitary, while the corresponding raw
coordinate derivative has zero weight.

The public implementation keeps these notions separate:

- `incoming_amplitude`: the oriented value valid for unrestricted angles;
- `metric`: `incoming_amplitude**2`;
- `sqrt_metric`: the principal nonnegative square root;
- `regular_coordinate_mask(atol=...)`: a tolerance-aware numerical regularity
  classification;
- `in_canonical_magnitude_domain`: the declared chart-domain check.

## 4. Complete addressed depth operator

At depth $d$, split a computational-basis label as

```math
|p\rangle_P|x\rangle_T|z\rangle_Z,
```

where:

- $p$ is the $d$-bit prefix;
- $x$ is the next qubit and is the rotation target;
- $z$ is the lower suffix of length
  ```math
  s=n-d-1.
  ```

The complete depth operator is

```math
\boxed{
L_d^{(n)}
=I+
\sum_{p=0}^{2^d-1}
|p\rangle\!\langle p|
\otimes
\bigl(R_y(\theta_{d,p})-I\bigr)
\otimes
|0^s\rangle\!\langle0^s|.
}
```

The rotation convention is

```math
R_y(\alpha)=e^{-i\alpha Y}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
\cos\alpha&-\sin\alpha\\
\sin\alpha&\cos\alpha
\end{pmatrix}.
```

Thus the prefix chooses the angle, the next qubit is the target, and the
complete lower suffix supplies one shared all-zero predicate.  Every nonzero
suffix sector is fixed.

The zero-suffix projector is essential.  It prevents a deeper tree rotation
from changing frame columns established by earlier depths.  It is also the
structural feature exploited by all three compiler schedules.

> **Proof checkpoint.** $L_d$ is a full operator, not a rule restricted to the
> preparation path.  Every proposed compiler must preserve its identity action
> on all nonzero-suffix sectors.

## 5. Two-qubit orientation

For two qubits, the three magnitude angles give

```math
|\psi\rangle
=
\cos\theta_1
\bigl(\cos\theta_2|00\rangle+
      \sin\theta_2|01\rangle\bigr)
+
\sin\theta_1
\bigl(\cos\theta_3|10\rangle+
      \sin\theta_3|11\rangle\bigr).
```

The unit frame directions are

```math
|e_1\rangle
=-\sin\theta_1
 \bigl(\cos\theta_2|00\rangle+
       \sin\theta_2|01\rangle\bigr)
+\cos\theta_1
 \bigl(\cos\theta_3|10\rangle+
       \sin\theta_3|11\rangle\bigr),
```

```math
|e_2\rangle
=-\sin\theta_2|00\rangle+
 \cos\theta_2|01\rangle,
```

```math
|e_3\rangle
=-\sin\theta_3|10\rangle+
 \cos\theta_3|11\rangle.
```

The differential weights are

```math
\partial_{\theta_1}|\psi\rangle=|e_1\rangle,
```

```math
\partial_{\theta_2}|\psi\rangle
=\cos\theta_1|e_2\rangle,
\qquad
\partial_{\theta_3}|\psi\rangle
=\sin\theta_1|e_3\rangle.
```

The marker assignment is

```math
\lambda(1)=10_2,
\qquad
\lambda(2)=01_2,
\qquad
\lambda(3)=11_2.
```

Hence, in computational column order,

```math
W_{\mathbb R}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
|&|&|&|\\
\psi&e_2&e_1&e_3\\
|&|&|&|
\end{pmatrix}.
```

This column order is the entire reason that a state-equivalent completion need
not be a valid differential-frame completion.  The numerical obstruction is
given in [the complete counterexample](COMPILER_BOUNDARIES.md#2-two-qubit-global-state-column-counterexample).

## 6. Phase-dressed complex magnitude frame

Attach one phase $\phi_\ell$ to every leaf and define

```math
D_{\mathrm{ph}}
=\sum_{\ell=0}^{N-1}
e^{i\phi_\ell}|\ell\rangle\!\langle\ell|.
```

The unitary used by the complex magnitude stream is

```math
\boxed{
W_{\mathbb C,\mathrm{mag}}
=D_{\mathrm{ph}}W_{\mathbb R}.
}
```

It contains the complex state and the $N-1$ phase-dressed magnitude-frame
directions.  The $N$ leaf-phase differentials are localized in the
computational basis and use a separate signed one-hot measurement record.  They
are not additional columns of this $N$-dimensional unitary.

Writing a basis label as $x=zb$, with the final bit as target,

```math
D_{\mathrm{ph}}
=
\sum_z |z\rangle\!\langle z|
\otimes
\begin{pmatrix}
e^{i\phi_{z0}}&0\\
0&e^{i\phi_{z1}}
\end{pmatrix}.
```

The phase dressing is therefore one exact $n$-qubit UCG.  Once the real frame
is compiled, the complex magnitude theorem is a short sequential-composition
corollary.

## 7. What the compiler theorem does not need

The following parts of the broader Hopf program are not premises of the
compiler construction:

- the inverse coordinate map;
- optimization convergence;
- the four-qubit pedagogical example;
- application-specific observables;
- a hardware-native gate set;
- the complete checkpoint protocol.

They remain important for the broader research program, but the synthesis
question is fully specified by the state column, marker columns, differential
weights, chart domains, and addressed-layer product above.
