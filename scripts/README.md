# Executable entry points

[← Repository landing page](../README.md) · [Verification map](../docs/VERIFICATION.md)

The scripts provide a readable orientation, resource ledgers, source checks,
exact verification receipts, and rendered presentation checks. They do not
replace the analytic proof.

## Technical walkthrough

```bash
python scripts/reviewer_walkthrough.py
```

This runs ten representative checks in the same order as the narrative:

1. recursive and addressed two-qubit frames agree;
2. canonical domains and singular coordinates are interpreted consistently;
3. one prepared column is insufficient;
4. the strict-zero four-sector identity holds;
5. the borrowed suffix bit is restored;
6. the explicit coherent router matches the tail direct sum;
7. the phase diagonal is one UCG;
8. the correct workspace schedule is selected;
9. the simultaneous workspace peak respects the supplied budget;
10. the low-workspace and maximal-cut inequalities hold.

## All-workspace ledger

```bash
python scripts/unified_resource_ledger.py --n 12
```

This displays the selected schedule and transparent integer resource terms over
representative clean-workspace budgets.  Use `--format json` for a
machine-readable record.

## Strict-zero ledger

```bash
python scripts/strict_zero_echo_ledger.py --n 12
```

This displays the per-depth borrowed-suffix UCG widths, predicate terms, and the
complete strict-zero size/depth proxies.

## Native coarse-frame example

```bash
python scripts/coarse_frame_native_example.py
python scripts/coarse_frame_native_example.py --case singular --format json
```

This bounded two-qubit example emits elementary Clifford+T words, checks
complete preparation and coherent dirty-input gradient means, and reports
literal counts against the original protocol with the same observable.
Its exact finite-size target is not a generic fine-precision compiler or an
advantage experiment. See the [scope and word proof](../docs/NATIVE_COARSE_QBP.md).

## Native residual QBP ledger

```bash
python scripts/residual_qbp_native_example.py
python scripts/residual_qbp_native_example.py --q 16 --format json
```

This emits both fine-residual gradient streams for a fixed complex
one-qubit target and reports exact coefficient, coarse-distance, gate,
and gradient-bias certificates. It also demonstrates the exact histogram
decoders. It performs no statevector propagation or sampling; the bounded
native numerical checks live in the test suite. See the
[integration proof and scope](../docs/NATIVE_RESIDUAL_QBP.md).

## Upstream synchronization

```bash
python scripts/check_upstream_sync.py --offline
```

The offline mode validates the recorded source schema and local lineage without
network access.  The tracked upstream commits and scientific reconciliation are
listed in [`SYNC.md`](../SYNC.md) and
[`provenance/upstream.json`](../provenance/upstream.json).

## Complete deterministic suite

```bash
python validate.py
```

The complete test map is in [`tests/README.md`](../tests/README.md).

## Fault-tolerant checks

Run `python scripts/verify_fault_tolerant.py` to reproduce four focused exact
source/kernel and rational-resource suites. See the
[scope and receipt guide](../verification/fault_tolerant/README.md). Temporary
outputs are used by default, leaving the expected evidence files unchanged.

## Visual checks

The optional `check_presentation.py` checker renders the diagrams and complete
Markdown pages, including tables, inline mathematics, and display equations.
It checks MathJax SVG and native MathML, including unsupported numbered rows
and vertically stacked equation glyphs, and saves desktop and narrow-screen
previews with measured layout checks.
The [rendering guide](../assets/README.md#rendering-checks) gives the separate
browser and MathJax dependencies and the reproducible command. These previews
model GitHub-style rendering; they do not reproduce GitHub's private client.
